# Welcome to my project, Java Sums!

Originally, this project just added two numbers together. Now, it can perform various arithmetic operations!

### Edge Cases
 
Various edge cases have not been implemented yet, including:
* Error for invalid operators exists, but the program currently breaks when this default occurs in the switch statement.
* Error for invalid number input (e.g. symbols or letters)
* Error for too many operators (e.g. ++, --, *-)
* Run again section needs to accept both 'y' and 'Y', currently it will break if user enters 'y'.

Basically, just be sensible and the program will work :)

Edge cases will be implemented in the future!

Now enjoy :))
